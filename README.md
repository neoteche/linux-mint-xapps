# linux-mint-xapps <br>
I will be making the linux mint xapps available to everyone because they are useful and amazing. All the apps will be packaged into an appimage.<br>
Apps ported:<br>
- Sticky<br>
# How to install
git clone the repo and launch it!<br>
Since this is an appimage it won't be installed but you can use it because it's a self contained packaging format.
